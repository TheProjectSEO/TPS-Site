      question: "What's the best time to visit Rome?",
      answer: "The best times to visit Rome are April-May and September-October when the weather is pleasant and crowds are more manageable. Summer (June-August) is hot and crowded, while winter (December-February) is mild but some attractions have reduced hours."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to book attractions in advance?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely! Popular attractions like the Colosseum, Vatican Museums, and Galleria Borghese require advance bookings. We recommend booking at least 2-3 weeks ahead, especially during peak season (April-October)."
    },
    {
      question: "How much should I budget for 3 days in Rome?",
      answer: "Budget travelers can expect to spend ‚Ç¨50-70 per day, mid-range travelers ‚Ç¨100-150 per day, and luxury travelers ‚Ç¨200+ per day. This includes accommodation, meals, attractions, and local transport."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the Roma Pass worth it?",

    },
    {
      question: "What should I wear when visiting religious sites?",

    },
    {
      question: "How do I get around Rome?",
      answer: "Rome's historic center is very walkable. For longer distances, use the metro, buses, or trams. Taxis are available but can be expensive. We recommend walking for most attractions as they're close together."
